 # 🏥 Healthcare-Performance-Dashboard
**Insights into Patient Flow & Operational Efficiency**


🔍 **Project Objective:**

The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into patient flow, departmental efficiency, and hospital performance. It supports hospital administrators and healthcare professionals in identifying trends, addressing bottlenecks, and discovering opportunities for improvement.


🛠️ **Tools & Technologies:**

● Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Custom Themes, UX Design)

● Python (for data generation and preprocessing)

● Excel (to simulate hospital data)

● DAX for calculated KPIs and advanced measures


📁 **Data Overview:**

Custom-generated synthetic data representing:

● Departments (Bed capacity, specialties)

● Department Daily (Admissions, Discharges, Bed Occupancy)

● Patient (Demographics)

● Staff Profile (Demographics and departmental classification)

● Hospital Stay (Patient records, Severity Level, Cost, Satisfaction scores, Readmission)


📈 **Key Metrics & KPIs:**

● Total Patients

● Average Satisfaction Score

● Bed Occupancy Rate (%)

● Readmission Rate

● Patient Volume by Department & Severity

● Avg. Hospital Stay by Severity

● Critical Case Ratio (Monthly)

● Bed Occupancy Rate Trends

● Readmission Rate by Gender


💡 **Insights Uncovered:**

● The Pediatrics and Oncology departments experience increased occupancy during the flu season.

● Satisfaction scores often decline mid-year, indicating potential staffing or seasonal issues.

● The readmission rates and critical case ratios vary slightly between genders, warranting further investigation.

● Bed occupancy peaks in December and January, corresponding with the height of the flu season.


📌 **Value Delivered:**

● Enabled hospital management to identify department-level performance issues.

● Improved understanding of critical care trends across the year.

● Offered clear visibility into how bed capacity was being utilized vs. available resources.

● Supported data-driven decision-making in patient care and resource planning.
